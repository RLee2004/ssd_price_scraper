# ssd_price_scraper
This is a Python script that uses the pypartpicker library to return a sorted list of SSDs based on price. I created this script for personal use to sort different SSD tiers, particularly when working with [NewMaxx's list of reputable SSDs](https://ssd.borecraft.com/SSD_Buying_Guide_List.pdf).
